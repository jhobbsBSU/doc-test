# CodeLab 1 - Documentation

## Intro

A short explanation of what you have been asked to build and a list of features that your vending machine including a specification list

### Specification
* Spec Item 1
* Spec Item 2
* Spec Item 3

## Techical Breakdown & Walkthrough

For this section you must record a video which includes a walkthrough of your program running as well as a technical breakdown of your code. This video should be add directly to the documentation (as per the example below). This technical breakdown should overview how the key features of your program have been implemented via code. The anticipated length of the video should be between 5 - 8 minutes, anything longer than 10minutes will not be reviewed and may result in a mark penalty. Stream is recommended to record your videos and is available within MS365.

## Critical Reflection

A critical reflection of your work that analyses what aspects of your Vending Machine you find compelling, what could be improved, and what programming skills you need to learn to make such improvements

## Appendix

A copy of your vending machine code, simply copy and paste from your code editor

```C++
// Replace the code below with your vending machine code

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```
